                            As a proud member of the LGBT+ community,
                            I was a volunteer for Queer Cal Pals, a Berkeley program that 
                            help new students connect with  LGBTQ+ community, 
                            as well as provide personal and social support during 
                            their transition to life at Cal.

                        <p>
                            I also manage a public official account that posts articles 
                            that promote equal rights ideas and organize events for 
                            gender minority communities in China.
