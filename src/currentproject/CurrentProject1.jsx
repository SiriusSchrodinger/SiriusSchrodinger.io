                We are interested in understanding the relationship between 
                biases/perception, the societal expectation of children, race, and children's play. 
                In particular, we are interested in the role race plays in 
                adults' perception of children's playful interactions. 
                The question this study intends to answer is: 
                Do adults perceive playful interactions or play differently based on 
                a child's racial identity? If so, to what extent do adults believe 
                a child's playfulness or play deserves to be addressed based on race?
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                To answer these questions, we are creating an MTurk experiment to 
                gather information about adults' perception of children's age and 
                how children should be intervened on various occasions, depending on their race.
