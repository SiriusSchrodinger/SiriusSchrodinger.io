                We are tackling gaming toxicity that is influencing 
                thousands of gamers every year, 
                especially gamers who identify as a member of minority communities. 
                We are interested in the cause and normalization of 
                toxic behaviors in gaming, and we are also trying to understand 
                the toxicity's influence on various subgroups of the gaming community.
